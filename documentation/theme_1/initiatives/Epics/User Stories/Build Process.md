User Story:
As a website developer, I want to have an automated build process for the website template, so that I can spend more time on development and less time on manual processes, ensuring efficient and fast development of the website.
Acceptance Criteria:

1. The build tools and dependencies required to build the website template are identified and documented.
2. A build script is developed that automates the build process and ensures that the website template is built consistently and reliably every time.
3. The build script is integrated with the version control system and continuous integration server to ensure that the website template is automatically built whenever changes are made to the codebase.
4. The build script is configured to generate different versions of the website template depending on the deployment environment, such as development, testing, and production.
5. The build script is tested and working as expected, including running tests and detecting errors or warnings. The build process should be fast, efficient, and error-free.

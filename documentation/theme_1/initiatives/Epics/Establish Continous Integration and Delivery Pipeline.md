Epic Name: Setting up Continuous Integration and Delivery Pipeline for MyWebClass Website Template Development

Description:
The Setting up Continuous Integration and Delivery Pipeline for MyWebClass Website Template Development epic focuses on establishing a continuous integration and delivery pipeline to improve the software development and deployment process for the MyWebClass website template. This epic involves selecting and configuring the necessary tools, implementing automation, and defining best practices to ensure that the development process is streamlined, efficient, and effective.

User Stories:

As a software developer, I want a continuous integration and delivery pipeline in place to automate the build, test, and deployment process and improve the speed and reliability of the software development process.
As a software developer, I want the necessary tools and infrastructure to be selected and configured correctly to ensure that the continuous integration and delivery pipeline is efficient and effective.
As a software developer, I want best practices defined and enforced to ensure consistency and quality across the software development process.
Tasks:

Select and configure the necessary tools for continuous integration and delivery, including version control, build tools, testing frameworks, and deployment tools.
Develop a pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment process for the MyWebClass website template development process.
Implement a process for continuous monitoring and feedback to identify and address issues with the pipeline and the development process.
Define and enforce best practices for software development, including coding standards, code review, and testing.
Integrate security testing into the continuous integration and delivery pipeline to ensure that the website template is secure and reliable.
Acceptance Criteria:

The continuous integration and delivery pipeline is established and automates the build, test, and deployment process for the MyWebClass website template development process.
The necessary tools are selected and configured correctly to ensure that the pipeline is efficient and effective.
A process for continuous monitoring and feedback is established to identify and address issues with the pipeline and the development process.
Best practices for software development are defined and enforced, including coding standards, code review, and testing.
Security testing is integrated into the continuous integration and delivery pipeline to ensure that the website template is secure and reliable.
